        1 Sun Apr 14 14:09:31 EDT 2013 Tiger has never come from behind and won ever on the last day! Well it's time for a change! Calling it right now tiger wins the green jacket
        1 Sun Apr 14 18:19:51 EDT 2013 I don't care what anyone says. @TigerWoods is still the best. Couldve won but just fell into an unlucky situation. He'll win a major this yr
        1 Fri Apr 12 16:28:32 EDT 2013 Tigers making that push!! #Tiiiigggeeerr
        1 Sun Apr 14 17:51:44 EDT 2013 Tiger is going to win this and the hand wringing and moralizing will be delicious to behold.
        1 Fri Apr 12 17:12:13 EDT 2013 Would be putting my money on tiger right now ,not the most dynamic of observations but as safe a sporting bet as they get come #tigerwoods

        0 Sat Apr 13 09:47:55 EDT 2013 @bytimgraham Tiger may as well DQ himself. If he wins it's so tainted no one will recognize the win.
        0 Sat Apr 13 09:43:22 EDT 2013 I am a great Tiger fan but rule 27-1A has been intentionally bent. He should DQ himself. Has he been saved by the ratings? Wrong again.
